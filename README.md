# Business Closure Prediction

This repository contains code for genrating predictions on whether a business will be closed during a given day of a disaster. Google data, Census information on the county, and FEMA data on zip code are used to generate predictions.

This is a demo application where users can upload the **claude4.csv** and generate predictions via a StreamLit application.
